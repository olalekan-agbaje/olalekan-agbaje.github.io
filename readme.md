# Weather Report

* A simple HTML/JS app preferably based on AngularJS v1 which, when you open the site, asks for a permission to read your current location, and then uses the http://openweathermap.org/current public API to fetch the weather for that location and displays it.
* If the user denies to share the location, show a little input form for entering postcode or country, and display the weather based on that location.


## Getting Started

Simply clone the project to your local machine and run the default index.html file. e.g 'http://localhost/CompucorpWeatherReport' 

### Prerequisities

There are no external dependencies outside of whatever is cloned. However, for testing pursposes you will need to have ["Protractor"](http://www.protractortest.org/) installed and setup on your machine. Visit http://www.protractortest.org/ to get started using Protractor for end-to-end tests.
